# Street Fighter Game (Java OOP Project)

## Overview

This is a Java-based implementation of a Street Fighter-style fighting game. The project aims to demonstrate core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles such as:

- **Inheritance:** Fighters share common properties and behaviors, which are inherited and specialized in different fighter classes.
- **Polymorphism:** The game allows fighters to perform different attacks depending on their type.
- **Encapsulation:** Encapsulated fighter attributes, such as health and attack power, ensure the internal state is properly managed.

The game is a simple two-player fighter simulation where each player controls a character to perform moves and fight until one character's health reaches zero.

## Features

- Select from multiple fighters, each with unique abilities.
- Basic combat mechanics with health, attack, and defense stats.
- Implemented using core Java OOP principles.

## Requirements

- Java 8 or higher.
- Maven 3+
- Any IDE or terminal that can run Java code.
